                        <br>1. Pizza Dough: Makes enough dough for two 10-12 inch pizzas
                        <br>2. 1 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105°F-115°F)
                        <br>3. 1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) of active dry yeast
                        <br>4. 3 3/4 cups (490 g) bread flour
                        <br>5. 2 Tbsp olive oil (omit if cooking pizza in a wood-fired pizza oven)
                        <br>6. 2 teaspoons salt
                        <br>7. 1 teaspoon sugar
                        <br>8. Pizza Ingredients
                        <br>9. Olive oil
                        <br>10. Cornmeal (to help slide the pizza onto the pizza stone)
                        <br><br><br>
                        <b>Method</b><br>
                        1.Proof the yeast: Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.<br>
                        2.Make and knead the pizza dough: Using the mixing paddle attachment, mix in the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.

<br>
                        3.Let the dough rise: Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.

At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.

Cover the dough with plastic wrap.<br>

Slide the pizza off of the peel and on to the baking stone in the oven.<br>

                    <p><b>Ingredients</b>
                    <br>1. 2 cups heavy cream
                    <br>2. 1 vanilla bean
                    <br>3. 1/2 cup sugar
                    <br>4. 1 1/2 teaspoons unflavored gelatin (about 1/2 packet)
                    <br>5. 1/2 cup whole milk
                    <br>6. 1/2 cup whole-milk Greek yogurt
                    <br>7. Sliced strawberries and fresh mint, for garnish (optional)
                    <br><br><br>
                        <b>Method</b><br>
            <br>1. Place the cream in a saucepan. Halve the vanilla bean lengthwise; scrape out the seeds with a knife, then add the seeds and pod to the saucepan.<br>2. Add the sugar and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally. Discard the vanilla pod.

    <br>3. Sprinkle the gelatin over the milk in a bowl and let stand until the gelatin softens, about 5 minutes. Stir the gelatin mixture into the hot cream mixture until dissolved,<br> then stir in the yogurt.<br>4.  Divide among six to eight 4-ounce ramekins, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, at least 6 hours or overnight.<br>

    <br>5. Dip each ramekin three-quarters of the way in warm water and invert onto a plate. Garnish each panna cotta with strawberries and mint, if desired.
