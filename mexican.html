                    <p><b>Ingredients</b>
                        <br>1. 12 ounces firm tofu, drained and cut into 8 slices
                        <br>2. 4 cups shredded coleslaw mix
                        <br>3. 1 small bunch radishes, thinly sliced
                        <br>4. 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
                        <br>5. 1 bunch scallions, sliced
                        <br>6. 1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
                        <br>7. 2 limes (1 zested and juiced, 1 cut into wedges)
                        <br>8. 1/4 cup nonfat plain Greek yogurt
                        <br>9. Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
                        <br>10. 1 tablespoon taco seasoning
                        <br>11. 8 8-inch whole-wheat tortillas
                        <br>12. 1/4 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella or pepper jack cheese
                        <br>13. 1/4 cup jarred salsa verde
                        <br><br><br>
                        <b>method</b>
                        <br>1. Lay the tofu slices flat on a stack of paper towels; top with more paper towels, then put a heavy skillet on top to press out the excess water, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, toss the coleslaw, radishes, cilantro, scallions, 1 tablespoon olive oil, the lime zest and half of the lime juice in a large bowl.<br>2.  Mix the yogurt with the remaining lime juice in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper.

                            <br>3. Brush the tofu on all sides with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with the taco seasoning. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, then add the tofu and cook until it begins to crisp, about 5 minutes; flip and cook 2 more minutes. Cut into strips.

                            <br>4. Toast the tortillas in a dry skillet, 1 minute per side, or wrap in a damp towel and microwave 1 minute. Fill with the tofu, cheese and slaw, then drizzle with the yogurt sauce and salsa. Serve with the lime wedges.
