                        <br>1. 5 sheets nori
                        <br>2. 2 cups sushi rice, recipe follows
                        <br>3. 2 ounces sushi-grade tuna, cut into1/4 by 1/2 by 3-inch strips
                        <br>4. 2 ounces sushi-grade salmon, cut into1/4 by 1/2 by 3-inch strips
                        <br>5. 1 hot house cucumber, julienne
                        <br>6. 1 carrot, peeled and julienne
                        <br>7. 1/2 avocado, thinly sliced
                        <br><br><br>
                        <b>method</b>
                        <br>1.Place a nori sheet lengthwise on a bamboo rolling mat, shiny-side down.<br>2. Position the sheet about 1-inch from the edge of the mat closest to you and leave some of the bamboo mat exposed on either side of the nori sheet. Wet your hands in cool water and take a handful of sushi rice. Place the rice in the center of the nori and use your fingers to spread the rice evenly over the nori. Be sure to leave a 3/4-inch strip of nori uncovered on the far side.<br>3. Place tuna strips and some julienne vegetable, cucumber or avocado along the center of the rice. Be careful not to overfill the nori. Place your fingertips over the fillings to hold them in place.<br>4. Then, use your thumbs to lift up the edge of the bamboo rolling mat closest to you. Begin rolling the mat away from you, while applying pressure to the fillings to keep the roll firm.<br>5. Roll the mat over slowly until it covers the rice and the near and far sides of rice join, still leaving the 3/4-inch strip of nori, rice-free, exposed. While holding the bamboo mat in position, apply pressure to the roll with your fingers to make the roll firm. Slice the roll in half, then cut both rolls twice to make 6 equal sized pieces.<br>6. Repeat this process with the salmon and various fillings, nori and rice.

                        <b>Ingredients</b> 
                                <br>1. 18 ounces red snapper fillet
                                <br>2. 1 teaspoon finely grated garlic
                                <br>3. 1 (3-inch) knob ginger, peeled and julienned very thinly and plunged briefly in cold water
                                <br>4. Menengi or chives
                                <br>5. 2 teaspoons white sesame seeds, toasted
                                <br>6. Yuzu Soy sauce, recipe follows
                                <br>7. 1 carrot curl, for garnish
                                <br>8. New Style Oil, recipe follows
                                <br><br><br>
                        <b>method</b>
                        <br>1.Cut fish fillet into paper-thin slices using the usu-zukuri cutting technique: Place fillet horizontally on chopping board with skin side up and tail end to left, steadying that side with fingers of left hand. Hold very sharp, long, thin-bladed pointed knife so that the top, blunt edge is inclined sharply to the right and, from the left side of fillet, start cutting paper-thin slices.<br>2. Keep the blade at an acute angle to achieve a clean cut across the grain. The fish is sliced in one drawing stroke. Let the weight of the knife do the work as you draw the blade back toward yourself. Keep fingers of left hand clear.

                        <br>3.Arrange fish slices on serving plate. On each slice dab a little grated garlic and place ginger spears and a few menengi or chives. <br>4.Sprinkle sesame seeds over fish.<br>5. Drizzle yuzu soy sauce over top of entire arrangement and garnish with carrot curl.
                        <br>6.Just prior to serving, heat the New Style Oil in a small frying pan until just before it begins to smoke.<br>7. Pour it over fish slices and serve.

                        <b>Ingredients</b> 
                        <br>1. 1/2 pound salmon fillet
                        <br>2. 4 cups uncooked, short-grain rice
                        <br>3. 5 3/4 cups water
                        <br>4. 2 sheets dried nori seaweed, or pre-toasted nori sheets
                        <br>5. 2 large pickled plums, pits removed and coarsely chopped
                        <br>6. 1/4 cup dried bonito flakes
                        <br>7. 1 1/2 teaspoons dark soy sauce
                        <br>8. 2 tablespoons black sesame seeds, toasted
                    <br><br><br>
                        <b>method</b>
                        <br>1.Sprinkle the salmon fillet with salt and let stand for 2 hours.

<br>2.Meanwhile, wash the rice thoroughly in cold water 30 to 60 minutes before cooking and let drain in colander. Place rice and water in a heavy, tightly covered saucepan over medium-high heat. When water just begins to boil, turn the heat to high and let it come to a vigorous boil. Reduce the heat to low and cook until all the liquid is absorbed by the rice, about 12 to 13 minutes.<br>3. Turn off the heat and let the rice stand, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes. Using a flat wooden spoon or rice paddle, fluff the rice with a cutting motion. Stretch a towel under the lid and cover tightly to keep warm until ready to use.

<br>4.Toast the nori sheets over a high gas flame, and cut crosswise into 1-inch wide strips, or use pre-toasted nori.

<br>5.Mix the bonito flakes with the soy sauce. Rinse the salt off the salmon, pat dry, and grill for 3 to 5 minutes. Use a fork to break the salmon into small pieces.

<br>6.Wet your hands with salted water to keep the rice from sticking to your hands. Cup one hand and place a handful of rice, about 1/2 cup, in your hand. Make an indentation in the rice and tuck in one of the fillings: a teaspoon of soaked bonito flakes, a few flakes of salmon, or a few pieces of pickled plum. Close the rice over the filling and mold it into a triangular shape.<br>7. Mold the rice firmly, pressing just hard enough to hold it together. Set the rice triangle down on one of its sides and cover the top peak with a strip of nori, shiny side out, like a roof. You can also make cylindrical shapes and wrap the nori around the middle.<br>8. Sprinkle sesame seeds over the rice shapes.

                        <br>4. 1 large egg, beaten
                        <br>5. 1 1/2 cups cold seltzer water
                        <br>6. 1/2 cup vodka
                        <br>7. 5 to 6 ounces sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1/8-inch thick slices
                        <br>8. Kosher salt
                        <br>9. 1/4 pound fresh green beans, trimmed
                        <br>10. 8 stems flat-leaf parsley
                        <br>11. 1/2 pound shrimp, 31 to 35 count, head and tail-on, peeled and deveined
                        <br>12. 1/2 pound tilapia fillets, cut into 1-inch pieces
                        <br>13. Ice
                        <br><br><br>
                        <b>method</b>
                        <br>1.Whisk the cake flour and rice flour together in a medium glass bowl and divide it in half. Set aside.

                        <br>2.Heat the vegetable oil in a 5-quart Dutch oven over high heat until it reaches 375 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer.

                        <br>3.Once the temperature reaches 365 degrees F, whisk the egg, seltzer water and vodka, in a medium mixing bowl and divide it in half.<br>4. Put half of the mixture in the refrigerator to reserve. Pour half of the liquid mixture into half of the dry mixture and whisk to combine, about 10 to 15 seconds.<br>5. Some lumps may remain. Set the glass bowl in a larger bowl lined with ice.

                        <br>6.Dip the sweet potatoes into the batter using tongs, drain for 2 to 3 seconds over the bowl, and then add to the hot oil. Adjust the heat to maintain between 375 and 400 degrees F. Fry 6 to 8 pieces, at a time, until puffy and very light golden, about 1 to 2 minutes<br>7. Remove to a cooling rack lined with 3 layers of paper towels set over a half sheet pan. Sprinkle with salt, if desired.
