                        <b>method</b>
                        <br>1.Combine yeast, warm water, and 1/4 tsp of granulated sugar in a liquid measuring cup. Stir to dissolve and let sit for 5 minutes until bubbly on top. Sift the remaining sugar, baking powder, and flour together in a large mixing bowl. Add the oil and the activated yeast mixture to the flour and stir with a spoon or spatula until a lumpy dough forms.<br>2. Once it becomes difficult to stir, use your hands to knead the dough, adding more flour if the dough is too sticky or water if it's too dry one teaspoon at a time, until it comes away cleanly from the bowl. Turn the dough onto a clean counter and knead by hand for another 5 minutes until smooth and elastic.<br>3.Return dough to the mixing bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour until doubled in size.

                        <br>4.In the meantime, making the filling. Place the cellophane noodles in a heatproof bowl and add enough boiling water to submerge the noodles completely. Drain the noodles after two minutes, they should be soft but not mushy. Once cooled, roughly cut the noodles into 1 inch segments.

                        <b>ingredients</b>
                        <br>1. 1 Chinese turnip/daikon radish (about 20 oz.), grated
                        <br>2. 1 cup water
                        <br>3. Oyster sauce for dipping (optional)
                        <br>4. white pepper, to taste
                        <br>5. ½ teaspoon sugar
                        <br>6. ½ teaspoon salt
                        <br>7. 1 tablespoon cornstarch
                        <br>8. 1 scallion, chopped
                        <br>9. 1 cup rice flour
                        <br>10.3-5 dried Chinese black mushrooms, washed, soaked, and chopped 
                        <br><br><br>
                        <b>method</b>
                            
                        <br> 1.Add grated turnip and 1 cup water to a wok or large pan and bring to a simmer. Simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally so the turnip does not brown. The turnip will produce liquid, some of which will evaporate. You will have ¾ to 1 cup liquid left in the pan with the radish but don't worry about measuring it. Pour everything (including the liquid) into a large mixing bowl to cool.
                        <br>2.Heat your pan over medium heat and add a couple tablespoons oil. Add the shrimp, mushrooms, and sausage and cook for about 5 minutes. Stir in the chopped scallion and remove from the heat to cool.
                        <br>3.Add rice flour, cornstarch, salt, sugar, and white pepper to the mixing bowl with the radish and cooking liquid. Mix well until the dry ingredients are well-incorporated. Add in the cooked shrimp, mushrooms and sausage, and be sure to scrape the oil from the pan into the batter. Mix well and let sit for about 15 minutes.
                        <br>4.Give the batter a final stir and pour it into a well-oiled loaf pan. Place the pan into a steamer with plenty of water and steam over medium-high heat for 50 minutes.
                        <br>5.Remove the pan from the steamer and let your turnip cake set for about 30 minutes. Once cooled, loosen the sides with a spatula and turn it out onto a cutting board.
